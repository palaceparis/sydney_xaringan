## Background

.pull-left[
The purpose of this statistical report is to bring light to what particular risk factors help predict infant birth weight. The future health of the infant can be predicted from the birth weight of the child.

&lt;br&gt;


The data was collected from Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Massachusetts in 1986 which is accessible in Rstudio via the MASS package under ‘birthwt’.

## Questions

.pull-left[
1. If smoking is in fact a predicting factor for birth weight of babies, in particular does it have a negative coefficient.

2. Does mother’s birth weight in the last menstrual period predict baby birth weight?

3. What are all the significant predicting factors of baby birth weight?

.font80[
.pull-left[
.content-box-blue[
Numerical variables:
- mother’s age (age)
- mother’s weight (lwt)
- number of premature labors (ptl)
- number of physician visits (ftv)
- birth weight of the child (bwt)
]
]

.pull-right[
.content-box-blue[
Categorical variables:
- low (birth weight below or above 2.5kg)
- race of mother (race)
- whether mother smokes (smoke)
- mother’s hypertension history (ht)
- mother’s presence of uterine irretability (ui)

## Pre Analysis Observations

.pull-left[
There are ten variables in this dataset, as shown by the summary statistics:

- Mean birth weight is approximately 2.9kg, which is 600 grams below the expected mean of 3.5kg. This is within the normal range of weights of 2.5kg - 4.5kg.


- Mother’s weight had a mean of 129.8 lb compared to the expected mean of 163.8 lb in 1999–2000. This may influence the lower range of birth weights of the babies.
